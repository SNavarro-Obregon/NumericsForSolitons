This is the repository for the collaboratively built website **Numerics for Solitons**, a resource for people learning the numerical methods needed to model _topological_ solitons such as kinks, skyrmions and vortices.

You can (currently) find the website at: https://chrishalcrow.github.io/NumericsForSolitons

You can add to the website easily using GitHub. There are some instructions [here](https://chrishalcrow.github.io/NumericsForSolitons).

The project began in Salamanca, April 2024.
