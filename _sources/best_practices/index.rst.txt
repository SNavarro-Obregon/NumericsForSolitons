Best Practices
==============

Coding is hard, so it's good to use best practices. Some of these require a little getting used 
to, and can take longer to get started with than writing bad code. It's up to you how "good" to
make your code. (Note from Chris: I only "understood" and enjoyed coding once I started doing
these things!!)
