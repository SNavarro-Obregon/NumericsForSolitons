Python
======

Python is a high-level programming language known for its readability, and the world's most popular language nowadays. Notably, it does not use semicolons or curly brackets, relying instead on indentation rules for structure. Python is categorized as an interpreted language, so here an interpreter translates the code into machine code line-by-line during execution. Additionally, Python is dynamically typed, allowing variables to be used without explicit declaration of their type, as types are inferred during execution.
