C++
===

C++ is a high-level programming language that can be likened to the C programming language but with the addition of classes. These classes enable it to function as an object-oriented language (see Object-oriented Coding tab). C++ is a statically typed language, requiring variables to be declared with their type and name before use. It is a pre-compiled language, meaning that the compiler translates the entire code into machine code (0s and 1s) at once, resulting in faster execution compared to interpreted languages.
